= PDF

PDF files focus on accurately describing documents visually, but also have facilities for annotating their structure. This hybrid approach makes them a good fit for document exchange: They render exactly the same on every device, but also support extraction of a document's content and structure (at least to an extent). Unlike PNG files, PDFs are not bound to a specific resolution. Hence, you can view them at any size without incurring a loss of quality.

== PDF standards

The International Standards Organization (ISO) has published the base PDF standard and various standards that extend it to make PDFs more suitable for specific use-cases. By default, Typst exports PDF 1.7 files. Adobe Acrobat 8 and later as well as all other commonly used PDF viewers are compatible with this PDF version.

Typst optionally supports emitting PDF/A-conformant files. PDF/A files are geared towards maximum compatibility with current and future PDF tooling. They do not rely on difficult-to-implement or proprietary features and contain exhaustive metadata. This makes them suitable for long-term archival.

The PDF/A Standard has multiple versions (_parts_ in ISO terminology) and most parts have multiple profiles that indicate the file's conformance level. Currently, Typst supports these PDF/A output profiles:

- PDF/A-2b: The basic conformance level of ISO 19005-2. This version of PDF/A is based on PDF 1.7 and results in self-contained, archivable PDF files.
- PDF/A-3b: The basic conformance level of ISO 19005-3. This version of PDF/A is based on PDF 1.7 and results in archivable PDF files that can contain arbitrary other related files as attachments. The only difference between it and PDF/A-2b is the capability to embed non-PDF/A-conformant files within.

When choosing between exporting PDF/A and regular PDF, keep in mind that PDF/A files contain additional metadata, and that some readers will prevent the user from modifying a PDF/A file. Some features of Typst may be disabled depending on the PDF standard you choose.

== Exporting as PDF

PDF is Typst's default export format. Running the `compile` or `watch` subcommand without specifying a format will create a PDF. When exporting to PDF, you have the following configuration options:

- Which PDF standards Typst should enforce conformance with by specifying --pdf-standard followed by one or multiple comma-separated standards. Valid standards are 1.7, a-2b, and a-3b. By default, Typst outputs PDF-1.7-compliant files.
- Which pages to export by specifying --pages followed by a comma-separated list of numbers or dash-separated number ranges. Ranges can be half-open. Example: 2,3,7-9,11-.

Click the quick download button at the top right to export a PDF with default settings. For further configuration, click "File" > "Export as" > "PDF" or click the downwards-facing arrow next to the quick download button and select "Export as PDF". When exporting to PDF, you have the following configuration options:

- Which PDF standards Typst should enforce conformance with. By default, Typst outputs PDF-1.7-compliant files. Valid additional standards are A-2b and A-3b.
- Which pages to export. Valid options are "All pages", "Current page", and "Custom ranges". Custom ranges are a comma-separated list of numbers or dash-separated number ranges. Ranges can be half-open. Example: 2,3,7-9,11-.

== PDF-specific functionality

Typst exposes PDF-specific functionality in the global `pdf` module. See below for the definitions it contains.

== Definitions

- #link("/docs/reference/pdf/embed/")[embed]A file that will be embedded into the output PDF.
= PNG

Instead of creating a PDF, Typst can also directly render pages to PNG raster graphics. PNGs are losslessly compressed images that can contain one page at a time. When exporting a multi-page document, Typst will emit multiple PNGs. PNGs are a good choice when you want to use Typst's output in an image editing software or when you can use none of Typst's other export formats.

In contrast to Typst's other export formats, PNGs are bound to a specific resolution. When exporting to PNG, you can configure the resolution as pixels per inch (PPI). If the medium you view the PNG on has a finer resolution than the PNG you exported, you will notice a loss of quality. Typst calculates the resolution of your PNGs based on each page's physical dimensions and the PPI. If you need guidance for choosing a PPI value, consider the following:

- A value of 300 or 600 is typical for desktop printing.
- Professional prints of detailed graphics can go up to 1200 PPI.
- If your document is only viewed at a distance, e.g. a poster, you may choose a smaller value than 300.
- If your document is viewed on screens, a typical PPI value for a smartphone is 400-500.

Because PNGs only contain a pixel raster, the text within cannot be extracted automatically (without OCR), for example by copy/paste or a screen reader. If you need the text to be accessible, export a PDF or HTML file instead.

PNGs can have transparent backgrounds. By default, Typst will output a PNG with an opaque white background. You can make the background transparent using `#set page(fill: none)`. Learn more on the #link("/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-fill")[page function's reference page].

== Exporting as PNG

Pass `--format png` to the `compile` or `watch` subcommand or provide an output file name that ends with `.png`.

If your document has more than one page, Typst will create multiple image files. The output file name must then be a template string containing at least one of

- `{p}`, which will be replaced by the page number
- `{0p}`, which will be replaced by the zero-padded page number (so that all numbers have the same length)
- `{t}`, which will be replaced by the total number of pages

When exporting to PNG, you have the following configuration options:

- Which resolution to render at by specifying --ppi followed by a number of pixels per inch. The default is 144.
- Which pages to export by specifying --pages followed by a comma-separated list of numbers or dash-separated number ranges. Ranges can be half-open. Example: 2,3,7-9,11-.

Click "File" > "Export as" > "PNG" or click the downwards-facing arrow next to the quick download button and select "Export as PNG". When exporting to PNG, you have the following configuration options:

- The resolution at which the pages should be rendered, as a number of pixels per inch. The default is 144.
- Which pages to export. Valid options are "All pages", "Current page", and "Custom ranges". Custom ranges are a comma-separated list of numbers or dash-separated number ranges. Ranges can be half-open. Example: 2,3,7-9,11-.
= Scripting

Typst embeds a powerful scripting language. You can automate your documents and create more sophisticated styles with code. Below is an overview over the scripting concepts.

== Expressions

In Typst, markup and code are fused into one. All but the most common elements are created with _functions._ To make this as convenient as possible, Typst provides compact syntax to embed a code expression into markup: An expression is introduced with a hash (`#`) and normal markup parsing resumes after the expression is finished. If a character would continue the expression but should be interpreted as text, the expression can forcibly be ended with a semicolon (`;`).

```typst
#emph[Hello] \
#emoji.face \
#"hello".len()
```

The example above shows a few of the available expressions, including #link("/docs/reference/foundations/function/")[function calls], #link("/docs/reference/scripting/#fields")[field accesses], and #link("/docs/reference/scripting/#methods")[method calls]. More kinds of expressions are discussed in the remainder of this chapter. A few kinds of expressions are not compatible with the hash syntax (e.g. binary operator expressions). To embed these into markup, you can use parentheses, as in `#(1 + 2)`.

== Blocks

To structure your code and embed markup into it, Typst provides two kinds of _blocks:_

- Code block: { let x = 1; x + 2 } When writing code, you'll probably want to split up your computation into multiple statements, create some intermediate variables and so on. Code blocks let you write multiple expressions where one is expected. The individual expressions in a code block should be separated by line breaks or semicolons. The output values of the individual expressions in a code block are joined to determine the block's value. Expressions without useful output, like let bindings yield none, which can be joined with any value without effect.
- Content block: [*Hey* there!] With content blocks, you can handle markup/content as a programmatic value, store it in variables and pass it to functions. Content blocks are delimited by square brackets and can contain arbitrary markup. A content block results in a value of type content. An arbitrary number of content blocks can be passed as trailing arguments to functions. That is, list([A], [B]) is equivalent to list[A][B].

Content and code blocks can be nested arbitrarily. In the example below, `[hello ]` is joined with the output of `a + [ the ] + b` yielding `[hello from the *world*]`.

```typst
#{
  let a = [from]
  let b = [*world*]
  [hello ]
  a + [ the ] + b
}
```

== Bindings and Destructuring

As already demonstrated above, variables can be defined with `let` bindings. The variable is assigned the value of the expression that follows the `=` sign. The assignment of a value is optional, if no value is assigned, the variable will be initialized as `none`. The `let` keyword can also be used to create a #link("/docs/reference/foundations/function/#defining-functions")[custom named function]. Variables can be accessed for the rest of the containing block (or the rest of the file if there is no containing block).

```typst
#let name = "Typst"
This is #name's documentation.
It explains #name.

#let add(x, y) = x + y
Sum is #add(2, 3).
```

Let bindings can also be used to destructure #link("/docs/reference/foundations/array/")[arrays] and #link("/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/")[dictionaries]. In this case, the left-hand side of the assignment should mirror an array or dictionary. The `..` operator can be used once in the pattern to collect the remainder of the array's or dictionary's items.

```typst
#let (x, y) = (1, 2)
The coordinates are #x, #y.

#let (a, .., b) = (1, 2, 3, 4)
The first element is #a.
The last element is #b.

#let books = (
  Shakespeare: "Hamlet",
  Homer: "The Odyssey",
  Austen: "Persuasion",
)

#let (Austen,) = books
Austen wrote #Austen.

#let (Homer: h) = books
Homer wrote #h.

#let (Homer, ..other) = books
#for (author, title) in other [
  #author wrote #title.
]
```

You can use the underscore to discard elements in a destructuring pattern:

```typst
#let (_, y, _) = (1, 2, 3)
The y coordinate is #y.
```

Destructuring also works in argument lists of functions ...

```typst
#let left = (2, 4, 5)
#let right = (3, 2, 6)
#left.zip(right).map(
  ((a,b)) => a + b
)
```

... and on the left-hand side of normal assignments. This can be useful to swap variables among other things.

```typst
#{
  let a = 1
  let b = 2
  (a, b) = (b, a)
  [a = #a, b = #b]
}
```

== Conditionals

With a conditional, you can display or compute different things depending on whether some condition is fulfilled. Typst supports `if`, `else if` and `else` expressions. When the condition evaluates to `true`, the conditional yields the value resulting from the if's body, otherwise yields the value resulting from the else's body.

```typst
#if 1 < 2 [
  This is shown
] else [
  This is not.
]
```

Each branch can have a code or content block as its body.

- `if condition {..}`
- `if condition [..]`
- `if condition [..] else {..}`
- `if condition [..] else if condition {..} else [..]`

== Loops

With loops, you can repeat content or compute something iteratively. Typst supports two types of loops: `for` and `while` loops. The former iterate over a specified collection whereas the latter iterate as long as a condition stays fulfilled. Just like blocks, loops _join_ the results from each iteration into one value.

In the example below, the three sentences created by the for loop join together into a single content value and the length-1 arrays in the while loop join together into one larger array.

```typst
#for c in "ABC" [
  #c is a letter.
]

#let n = 2
#while n < 10 {
  n = (n * 2) - 1
  (n,)
}
```

For loops can iterate over a variety of collections:

- for value in array {..} Iterates over the items in the array. The destructuring syntax described in Let binding can also be used here.
- for pair in dict {..} Iterates over the key-value pairs of the dictionary. The pairs can also be destructured by using for (key, value) in dict {..}. It is more efficient than for pair in dict.pairs() {..} because it doesn't create a temporary array of all key-value pairs.
- for letter in "abc" {..} Iterates over the characters of the string. Technically, it iterates over the grapheme clusters of the string. Most of the time, a grapheme cluster is just a single codepoint. However, a grapheme cluster could contain multiple codepoints, like a flag emoji.
- for byte in bytes("😀") {..} Iterates over the bytes, which can be converted from a string or read from a file without encoding. Each byte value is an integer between 0 and 255.

To control the execution of the loop, Typst provides the `break` and `continue` statements. The former performs an early exit from the loop while the latter skips ahead to the next iteration of the loop.

```typst
#for letter in "abc nope" {
  if letter == " " {
    break
  }

  letter
}
```

The body of a loop can be a code or content block:

- `for .. in collection {..}`
- `for .. in collection [..]`
- `while condition {..}`
- `while condition [..]`

== Fields

You can use _dot notation_ to access fields on a value. For values of type #link("/docs/reference/foundations/content/")[content], you can also use the #link("/docs/reference/foundations/content/#definitions-fields")[fields] function to list the fields.

The value in question can be either:

- a #link("/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/")[dictionary] that has the specified key,
- a #link("/docs/reference/foundations/symbol/")[symbol] that has the specified modifier,
- a #link("/docs/reference/foundations/module/")[module] containing the specified definition,
- #link("/docs/reference/foundations/content/")[content] consisting of an element that has the specified field. The available fields match the arguments of the #link("/docs/reference/foundations/function/#element-functions")[element function] that were given when the element was constructed.

```typst
#let it = [= Heading]
#it.body \
#it.depth \
#it.fields()

#let dict = (greet: "Hello")
#dict.greet \
#emoji.face
```

== Methods

A _method call_ is a convenient way to call a function that is scoped to a value's #link("/docs/reference/foundations/type/")[type]. For example, we can call the #link("/docs/reference/foundations/str/#definitions-len")[str.len] function in the following two equivalent ways:

```typst
#str.len("abc") is the same as
#"abc".len()
```

The structure of a method call is `value.method(..args)` and its equivalent full function call is `type(value).method(value, ..args)`. The documentation of each type lists its scoped functions. You cannot currently define your own methods.

```typst
#let values = (1, 2, 3, 4)
#values.pop() \
#values.len() \

#("a, b, c"
    .split(", ")
    .join[ --- ])

#"abc".len() is the same as
#str.len("abc")
```

There are a few special functions that modify the value they are called on (e.g. #link("/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-push")[array.push]). These functions _must_ be called in method form. In some cases, when the method is only called for its side effect, its return value should be ignored (and not participate in joining). The canonical way to discard a value is with a let binding: `let _ = array.remove(1)`.

== Modules

You can split up your Typst projects into multiple files called _modules._ A module can refer to the content and definitions of another module in multiple ways:

- Including: include "bar.typ" Evaluates the file at the path bar.typ and returns the resulting content.
- Import: import "bar.typ" Evaluates the file at the path bar.typ and inserts the resulting module into the current scope as bar (filename without extension). You can use the as keyword to rename the imported module: import "bar.typ" as baz. You can import nested items using dot notation: import "bar.typ": baz.a.
- Import items: import "bar.typ": a, b Evaluates the file at the path bar.typ, extracts the values of the variables a and b (that need to be defined in bar.typ, e.g. through let bindings) and defines them in the current file. Replacing a, b with * loads all variables defined in a module. You can use the as keyword to rename the individual items: import "bar.typ": a as one, b as two

Instead of a path, you can also use a #link("/docs/reference/foundations/module/")[module value], as shown in the following example:

```typst
#import emoji: face
#face.grin
```

== Packages

To reuse building blocks across projects, you can also create and import Typst _packages._ A package import is specified as a triple of a namespace, a name, and a version.

```typst
#import "@preview/example:0.1.0": add
#add(2, 7)
```

The `preview` namespace contains packages shared by the community. You can find all available community packages on #link("https://typst.app/universe/")[Typst Universe].

If you are using Typst locally, you can also create your own system-local packages. For more details on this, see the #link("https://github.com/typst/packages")[package repository].

== Operators

The following table lists all available unary and binary operators with effect, arity (unary, binary) and precedence level (higher binds stronger). Some operations, such as #link("/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-rem-euclid")[modulus], do not have a special syntax and can be achieved using functions from the #link("/docs/reference/foundations/calc/")[calc] module.
= Styling

Typst includes a flexible styling system that automatically applies styling of your choice to your document. With _set rules,_ you can configure basic properties of elements. This way, you create most common styles. However, there might not be a built-in property for everything you wish to do. For this reason, Typst further supports _show rules_ that can completely redefine the appearance of elements.

== Set rules

With set rules, you can customize the appearance of elements. They are written as a #link("/docs/reference/foundations/function/")[function call] to an #link("/docs/reference/foundations/function/#element-functions")[element function] preceded by the `set` keyword (or `#set` in markup). Only optional parameters of that function can be provided to the set rule. Refer to each function's documentation to see which parameters are optional. In the example below, we use two set rules to change the #link("/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font")[font family] and #link("/docs/reference/model/heading/#parameters-numbering")[heading numbering].

```typst
#set heading(numbering: "I.")
#set text(
  font: "New Computer Modern"
)

= Introduction
With set rules, you can style
your document.
```

A top level set rule stays in effect until the end of the file. When nested inside of a block, it is only in effect until the end of that block. With a block, you can thus restrict the effect of a rule to a particular segment of your document. Below, we use a content block to scope the list styling to one particular list.

```typst
This list is affected: #[
  #set list(marker: [--])
  - Dash
]

This one is not:
- Bullet
```

Sometimes, you'll want to apply a set rule conditionally. For this, you can use a _set-if_ rule.

```typst
#let task(body, critical: false) = {
  set text(red) if critical
  [- #body]
}

#task(critical: true)[Food today?]
#task(critical: false)[Work deadline]
```

== Show rules

With show rules, you can deeply customize the look of a type of element. The most basic form of show rule is a _show-set rule._ Such a rule is written as the `show` keyword followed by a #link("/docs/reference/foundations/selector/")[selector], a colon and then a set rule. The most basic form of selector is an #link("/docs/reference/foundations/function/#element-functions")[element function]. This lets the set rule only apply to the selected element. In the example below, headings become dark blue while all other text stays black.

```typst
#show heading: set text(navy)

= This is navy-blue
But this stays black.
```

With show-set rules you can mix and match properties from different functions to achieve many different effects. But they still limit you to what is predefined in Typst. For maximum flexibility, you can instead write a show rule that defines how to format an element from scratch. To write such a show rule, replace the set rule after the colon with an arbitrary #link("/docs/reference/foundations/function/")[function]. This function receives the element in question and can return arbitrary content. The available #link("/docs/reference/scripting/#fields")[fields] on the element passed to the function again match the parameters of the respective element function. Below, we define a show rule that formats headings for a fantasy encyclopedia.

```typst
#set heading(numbering: "(I)")
#show heading: it => [
  #set align(center)
  #set text(font: "Inria Serif")
  \~ #emph(it.body)
     #counter(heading).display(
       it.numbering
     ) \~
]

= Dragon
With a base health of 15, the
dragon is the most powerful
creature.

= Manticore
While less powerful than the
dragon, the manticore gets
extra style points.
```

Like set rules, show rules are in effect until the end of the current block or file.

Instead of a function, the right-hand side of a show rule can also take a literal string or content block that should be directly substituted for the element. And apart from a function, the left-hand side of a show rule can also take a number of other _selectors_ that define what to apply the transformation to:

- Everything: show: rest => .. Transform everything after the show rule. This is useful to apply a more complex layout to your whole document without wrapping everything in a giant function call.
- Text: show "Text": .. Style, transform or replace text.
- Regex: show regex("\w+"): .. Select and transform text with a regular expression for even more flexibility. See the documentation of the regex type for details.
- Function with fields: show heading.where(level: 1): .. Transform only elements that have the specified fields. For example, you might want to only change the style of level-1 headings.
- Label: show <intro>: .. Select and transform elements that have the specified label. See the documentation of the label type for more details.

```typst
#show "Project": smallcaps
#show "badly": "great"

We started Project in 2019
and are still working on it.
Project is progressing badly.
```
= SVG

Instead of creating a PDF, Typst can also directly render pages to scalable vector graphics (SVGs), which are the preferred format for embedding vector graphics in web pages. Like PDF files, SVGs display your document exactly how you have laid it out in Typst. Likewise, they share the benefit of not being bound to a specific resolution. Hence, you can print or view SVG files on any device without incurring a loss of quality. (Note that font printing quality may be better with a PDF.) In contrast to a PDF, an SVG cannot contain multiple pages. When exporting a multi-page document, Typst will emit multiple SVGs.

SVGs can represent text in two ways: By embedding the text itself and rendering it with the fonts available on the viewer's computer or by embedding the shapes of each glyph in the font used to create the document. To ensure that the SVG file looks the same across all devices it is viewed on, Typst chooses the latter method. This means that the text in the SVG cannot be extracted automatically, for example by copy/paste or a screen reader. If you need the text to be accessible, export a PDF or HTML file instead.

SVGs can have transparent backgrounds. By default, Typst will output an SVG with an opaque white background. You can make the background transparent using `#set page(fill: none)`. Learn more on the #link("/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-fill")[page function's reference page].

== Exporting as SVG

Pass `--format svg` to the `compile` or `watch` subcommand or provide an output file name that ends with `.svg`.

If your document has more than one page, Typst will create multiple image files. The output file name must then be a template string containing at least one of

- `{p}`, which will be replaced by the page number
- `{0p}`, which will be replaced by the zero-padded page number (so that all numbers have the same length)
- `{t}`, which will be replaced by the total number of pages

When exporting to SVG, you have the following configuration options:

- Which pages to export by specifying `--pages` followed by a comma-separated list of numbers or dash-separated number ranges. Ranges can be half-open. Example: `2,3,7-9,11-`.

Click "File" > "Export as" > "SVG" or click the downwards-facing arrow next to the quick download button and select "Export as SVG". When exporting to SVG, you have the following configuration options:

- Which pages to export. Valid options are "All pages", "Current page", and "Custom ranges". Custom ranges are a comma-separated list of numbers or dash-separated number ranges. Ranges can be half-open. Example: `2,3,7-9,11-`.
= Symbols

These two modules give names to symbols and emoji to make them easy to insert with a normal keyboard. Alternatively, you can also always directly enter Unicode symbols into your text and formulas. In addition to the symbols listed below, math mode defines `dif` and `Dif`. These are not normal symbol values because they also affect spacing and font style.

== Definitions

- #link("/docs/reference/symbols/sym/")[sym]These two modules give names to symbols and emoji to make them easy to insert
- #link("/docs/reference/symbols/emoji/")[emoji]These two modules give names to symbols and emoji to make them easy to insert

== Shorthands

Shorthands are concise sequences of characters that evoke specific glyphs. Shorthands and other ways to produce symbols can be used interchangeably. You can use different sets of shorthands in math and markup mode. Some shorthands, like `~` for a non-breaking space produce non-printing symbols, which are indicated with gray placeholder text.

You can deactivate a shorthand's interpretation by escaping any of its characters. If you escape a single character in a shorthand, the remaining unescaped characters may form a different shorthand.

= Syntax

Typst is a markup language. This means that you can use simple syntax to accomplish common layout tasks. The lightweight markup syntax is complemented by set and show rules, which let you style your document easily and automatically. All this is backed by a tightly integrated scripting language with built-in and user-defined functions.

== Modes

Typst has three syntactical modes: Markup, math, and code. Markup mode is the default in a Typst document, math mode lets you write mathematical formulas, and code mode lets you use Typst's scripting features.

You can switch to a specific mode at any point by referring to the following table:

Once you have entered code mode with `#`, you don't need to use further hashes unless you switched back to markup or math mode in between.

== Markup

Typst provides built-in markup for the most common document elements. Most of the syntax elements are just shortcuts for a corresponding function. The table below lists all markup that is available and links to the best place to learn more about their syntax and usage.

== Math mode

Math mode is a special markup mode that is used to typeset mathematical formulas. It is entered by wrapping an equation in `$` characters. This works both in markup and code. The equation will be typeset into its own block if it starts and ends with at least one space (e.g. `$ x^2 $`). Inline math can be produced by omitting the whitespace (e.g. `$x^2$`). An overview over the syntax specific to math mode follows:

== Code mode

Within code blocks and expressions, new expressions can start without a leading `#` character. Many syntactic elements are specific to expressions. Below is a table listing all syntax that is available in code mode:

== Comments

Comments are ignored by Typst and will not be included in the output. This is useful to exclude old versions or to add annotations. To comment out a single line, start it with `//`:

```typst
// our data barely supports
// this claim

We show with $p < 0.05$
that the difference is
significant.
```

Comments can also be wrapped between `/*` and `*/`. In this case, the comment can span over multiple lines:

```typst
Our study design is as follows:
/* Somebody write this up:
   - 1000 participants.
   - 2x2 data design. */
```

== Escape sequences

Escape sequences are used to insert special characters that are hard to type or otherwise have special meaning in Typst. To escape a character, precede it with a backslash. To insert any Unicode codepoint, you can write a hexadecimal escape sequence: `\u{1f600}`. The same kind of escape sequences also work in #link("/docs/reference/foundations/str/")[strings].

```typst
I got an ice cream for
\$1.50! \u{1f600}
```

== Paths

Typst has various features that require a file path to reference external resources such as images, Typst files, or data files. Paths are represented as #link("/docs/reference/foundations/str/")[strings]. There are two kinds of paths: Relative and absolute.

- A relative path searches from the location of the Typst file where the feature is invoked. It is the default: #image("images/logo.png")
- An absolute path searches from the root of the project. It starts with a leading /: #image("/assets/logo.png")

By default, the project root is the parent directory of the main Typst file. For security reasons, you cannot read any files outside of the root directory.

If you want to set a specific folder as the root of your project, you can use the CLI's `--root` flag. Make sure that the main file is contained in the folder's subtree!

In the web app, the project itself is the root directory. You can always read all files within it, no matter which one is previewed (via the eye toggle next to each Typst file in the file panel).

A package can only load files from its own directory. Within it, absolute paths point to the package root, rather than the project root. For this reason, it cannot directly load files from the project directory. If a package needs resources from the project (such as a logo image), you must pass the already loaded image, e.g. as a named parameter `logo: image("mylogo.svg")`. Note that you can then still customize the image's appearance with a set rule within the package.

In the future, paths might become a #link("https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/971")[distinct type from strings], so that they can retain knowledge of where they were constructed. This way, resources could be loaded from a different root.
